# UMBRELLA ADS ARCHIVE

This folder contains the de-obfuscated and reworked Umbrella marketing pages. Files are organized by version.

- Umbrella 18.NOV2025.html — current readable campaign ad with structured tabs, widened navigation buttons, and reorganized overview sections.
- Umbrella_18.NOV2025.decoded.html — the decoded version of the original obfuscated ad, kept for reference.
- Umbrella Corporation By_NND.html — the untouched legacy HTML pulled in for comparison/reference.

Use the readable 18.NOV2025 file for edits, and keep the decoded/legacy copies untouched as source material.
